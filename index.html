<h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>

</li> <br>
<li> <strong> 1935</strong>
    - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation <br>
     Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. <br>
      "All of this left scars on me."

</li> <br>
<li> <strong>1937</strong>

</li> <br>
<li> <strong>1938</strong>
    - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off  <br>
     due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns <br>
      to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
</li> <br>
<li><strong>1941</strong> 
    - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack,<br>
     but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, <br>
      DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science
</li> <br>
<li> <strong> 1942</strong> 
    - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
</li> <br>

<li> <strong>1944</strong>
    - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, <br>
     and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, <br>
      his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - <br>
       including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
</li> <br>
<li> <strong>1945</strong>
    - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
</li> <br>
<li><strong>1953</strong>
    - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, <br>
     creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. <br>
      It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
</li> <br>
<li><strong>1962</strong>
    - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent <br>
     in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
</li> <br>
<li><strong>1970</strong>
    - receives the Nobel Peace Prize
</li>
<li><strong>1983</strong>
    - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their
</li> <br>
<li><strong>1984</strong>
    - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University
</li> <br>
<li><strong>2005</strong>
    - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically <br>
     modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. <br>
      Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically <br>
       modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,<br>
        people were selecting the best breeds."
</li> <br>
<li><strong>2009</strong>
    - dies at the age of 95.
